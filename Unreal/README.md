# Unreal projects
## Import
This folder contains items that are imported into my projects, such as models
and sound clips.

##EndlessRunner
This is the directory for the EndlessRunner game I am creating for my personal
project. These files are the assets that change as I work on the project, the
game will be built in Unreal to run properly, those files are too big to be
included in this repo. Experimenting on the easiest way to make sure a playable
game is included here. Changelog to follow.
